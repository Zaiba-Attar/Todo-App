# Todo-App
I have created an attractive Todo app built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript with multiple features that allows the users to edit, remove, and with pop up message if empty. These tasks gets stored in the local Storage of the user's browser and they won't get deleted until you delete it! Give it a try..
